	<h1>Levangen Software</h1>
	<p>Levangen software was founded by a friend of ours who originally intended to use it for making games and other such programs</p>
	<p>A couple of years later, we wanted to make a website and couldn't think of an original name so we just asked him if we could use Levangen</p>
	<p>all of the HTML, CSS and assets for this website will come under the MIT license once we have created something worth licensing</p>
